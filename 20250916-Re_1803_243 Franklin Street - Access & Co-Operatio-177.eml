To address the backlog, let=E2=80=99s be clear: the hold-up isn=E2=80=99t o=
n my end. If
there=E2=80=99s any intention of moving this project forward efficiently, I=
 suggest
we begin with a reality check and a workable plan.
------------------------------

*Some basics*

   1.

   *Vacating is not in my budget.* If you're proposing that option, please
   confirm in writing that you will cover the full cost of *temporary
   accommodation, moving, and appropriate compensation* for the entire
   duration the property is uninhabitable.
   2.

   *"Sleeping in the living room" is not a form of temporary accommodation.=
*
   It lacks privacy, doors, a kitchen, and, frankly, basic dignity. If you
   truly believe it=E2=80=99s livable, I invite you to spend a week there y=
ourself and
   reassess.
   3.

   When the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, or essential circulation areas are
   unusable, the property is *uninhabitable*. This is a home, not a
   survival challenge.

------------------------------

*Regarding the CAV link you attached:*

The page you referenced is general information. It=E2=80=99s not a magic wa=
nd that
shifts all responsibility to the renter, nor does it grant permission to
bypass planning, risk mitigation, or defining who=E2=80=99s actually in cha=
rge of
what.

Even your own documentation acknowledges:

   -

   The bedroom must be =E2=80=9Ccompletely cleared=E2=80=9D for works invol=
ving materials
   that *=E2=80=9Cmay present risk,=E2=80=9D* with explicit notes that rent=
ers are *=E2=80=9Cnot
   permitted to remain in the room during works.=E2=80=9D*
   -

   Phase 1 spans *several consecutive days*, followed by Phase 2
   demolition/repairs to walls, skirting, and carpet.
   -

   The contractor recommends *removing plasterboard floor to ceiling*, with
   potential ceiling removal and skirting ripped out=E2=80=94so no, this is=
 not a
   =E2=80=9Cmove the bed and we=E2=80=99re done=E2=80=9D situation. It=E2=
=80=99s prolonged noise, dust, and
   disruption.

------------------------------

To avoid wasting anyone=E2=80=99s time: if the agency=E2=80=99s role is to =
forward
templates and skim a margin, just let me know. I=E2=80=99d prefer to speak =
directly
with someone capable of reading standards *and* applying them=E2=80=94with =
critical
thinking, ideally.
------------------------------

*Summary:* Offloading cost, risk, and inconvenience onto the tenant, while
offering a living room as a substitute for proper lodging, isn=E2=80=99t
=E2=80=9Cassistance.=E2=80=9D It=E2=80=99s exploitation wrapped in bureaucr=
atic convenience. My
home is not a job site annex, and the living room isn=E2=80=99t a hotel sui=
te.

Looking forward to a response grounded in actual planning.


Thanks

Chawakorn
